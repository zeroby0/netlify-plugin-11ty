# Netlify 11ty Build Plugin

A plugin to make building with Eleventy and Netlify a joy!

### Speed up your builds âš¡

- Caches images generated by
  [@11ty/eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img) across builds
- Caches assets fetched by
  [@11ty/eleventy-fetch](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-fetch) across builds
- Caches any other folders of your choice (optional)

## Install

Install plugin via your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm i netlify-plugin-11ty
```

And add the plugin to your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[[plugins]]
    package = "netlify-plugin-11ty"
    [plugins.inputs]
        # eleventy-img outputDir, path relative to publish directory
        cache_img = 'img/'
        cache_img_httpHeader = false

        # eleventy-fetch cacheDir, path relative to publish directory
        cache_assets = '../.cache/'
        cache_other = []
```

Make sure the path for [`cache_img`](#1-cache_img) is correct. Aand you're done!

## Documentation

### 1. `cache_img`

Type: `String` or `Array of Strings`  
Default: `'img'` (relative to the publish directory)

Path to the folder(s) in which files generated by `@11ty/eleventy-img` are
stored, relative to the publish directory. Can be a String or an array of
Strings.

If set to `false`, files generated by `@11ty/eleventy-img` are not saved in
Netlify cache.

### 2. `cache_img_httpHeader`

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If set to `true`, files generated by `@11ty/eleventy-img` will be served with
http header `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

Files generated by `eleventy_img` have a hash calculated using file content and
[Sharp plugin options](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#advanced-control-of-sharp-image-processor)
in their name by default
([starting from #116](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img/pull/116)), so you
can cache them indefinitely. Don't use this if you're using remote images.

:warning: **Caution**:

- If you are using remote images, this option should be `false` (default).
- If you are using
  [custom filenames](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#custom-filenames-new-in-image-0.4.0)
  that don't include a hash, this option should be `false` (default).

### 3. `cache_assets`

Type: `String` or `Array of Strings`  
Default: `'../.cache'` (relative to the publish directory)

Path to the folder(s) in which remote assets fetched by
[@11ty/eleventy-fetch](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-fetch) are cached,
relative to publish directory. Can be a String or an array of Strings.

If set to `false`, assets fetched by `@11ty/eleventy-fetch` are not saved in
Netlify cache.

### 4. `cache_other`

Type: `String` or `Array of Strings`  
Default: `[]` (relative to the publish directory)

Paths to any other folder(s) you'd like to cache across Netlify builds. If these
folders exist before restoring Nelify cache, their content will be merged and
overwritten with content from the cached folders.

## FAQs

### I `rimraf` my `_site` on every build

If your images are written to `_site/img` (default), use
`rimraf '_site/!(img)'`.

If they are in a subdirectory, say `_site/assets/images`, use
`rimraf '_site/!(assets)' '_site/assets/!(images)'`.

### Are there any Benchmarks?

Yes!

The speed-up, ofcourse, depends on how many images your website has, but here is
a benchmark I used when developing this plugin:

| Run                    | No cache persistence | With cache persistence  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1st run (empty cache)  | 11.74 seconds        | 11.52 seconds           |
| 2nd run (filled cache) | 11.32 seconds        | 131.82 **milliseconds** |
